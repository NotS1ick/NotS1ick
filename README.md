# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm NotS1ick

Things I love doing in my free time **`(Programming, Photoshoping, Video Editing, Gaming, Cft's)`**

You may ask who am I. I'm a teen who **`loves programming`**, **`cft's`** and **`cybersecurity`** related things. I'm that kind of person who **`helps
people`** who are having a **`problem`** with their computer or they have been defrauded, hacked or their computers have been infected.<br>
My stance on things is very neutral unless it's related to things like black hat hacking. I think that black hat hacking is a horible thing<br> they defraud people of money that they've earned for years and they just go away with the money and spend it on bitcoin and partying.
