### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im NotS1ick

You may ask who am I. I'm a teen who loves programming, cft's and cybersecurity related things. I'm that kind of person who helps <br>
people who are having a problem with their computer or they have been defrauded, hacked or their computers have been infected. My stance on things<br>
is very neutral unless it's related to things like black hat hacking. I think that black hat hacking is a horible thing<br>
they defraud people of money that they've earned for years and they just go away with the money and spend it on bitcoin and partying.
