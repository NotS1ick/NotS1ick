# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm NotS1ick

Things I love doing in my free time **`(Programming, Photoshoping, Video Editing, Gaming, Cft's)`**

You may ask who am I. I'm a teen who loves programming, cft's and cybersecurity related things. I'm that kind of person who helps <br>
people who are having a problem with their computer or they have been defrauded, hacked or their computers have been infected. My stance on things is very neutral unless it's related to things like black hat hacking.<br>
I think that black hat hacking is a horible thing<br>they defraud people of money that they've earned for years <br>
and they just go away with the money and spend it on bitcoin and partying.
